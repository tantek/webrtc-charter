# WebRTC Working Group workmode

This document proposes a set of guiding principles to ensure clear responsibilities and set expectations in enabling productive discussions towards consensus in the WebRTC Working Group.

## Issue management

The Chairs are responsible for prioritizing issues that need a Working Group decision, with a focus on ensuring practical interoperable implementations of the relevant specifications, including through input from implementers on issues with the most impact on their implementation effort. Prioritizing these issues includes managing possible interdependencies between them. For high-priority issues, the Chairs should maintain a clear understanding of what might be blocking their progress and specific plans to drive a resolution, using synchronous and asynchronous approaches.

An issue with more than 10 comments makes it difficult for people to grasp; issue comments should only be used to bring new information that would help the group make a decision. In particular:
* An argument that has already been made in an issue thread does not need to be repeated.
* Beyond an initial tagging of relevant participants, issue comments should not be used to bring attention from or to a particular individual.

The Chairs may temporarily lock an issue where comments are no longer helping make consensus emerge. The Chairs are responsible for suggesting a path forward in such a situation.

When progress in an issue stalls (e.g. because no consensus seems to be emerging), Working Group participants that need rapid resolution of the said issue (e.g. because of implementation schedule) should raise it by email to the Chairs' attention, contextualizing the time-sensitiveness. The Chairs are then responsible for assessing the priority of the said issue.

## Github issue etiquette

1. Think over your comments before you write, and check them before submitting. Try to keep them as clear and succinct as possible.

2. Always keep to the topic of the issue. If there are other things you want to bring up, raise additional issues. The aim should be to keep each issue focused on a specific topic.

3. Always remain polite and constructive in your comments. Do not assign intent or interpretations to other contributors' comments.

4. You can attract someone's attention to an issue where their input would be useful, by including an @ sign followed by their github id; but once someone has been flagged in an issue, and if you want to draw their attention to a new point, use discretion in flagging them again publicly (vs contacting them out of band, e.g. by email).

## Meetings under the WebRTC Working Group umbrella

The (generally monthly) WebRTC Working Group meeting is used to establish the level of Working Group consensus on issues and proposals that require a Working Group decision. The Chairs are responsible for ensuring the highest priority issues get sufficient time to unblock progress, in particular where the decision is time sensitive.


The weekly WebRTC Editors meeting is used to facilitate progress on the editorial work needed to update specifications, through:
* Merging pull requests that represent an existing Working Group decision, to the satisfaction of the spec editors and chairs
* Identifying pull requests that need more editorial work with a well-defined owner (through pull request assignee)
* Identifying pull requests that reveal lack of clarity on the Working Group decision and that needs to be brought back to the group via discussion in an issue; these pull requests should be marked as draft
* Identifying issues whose discussion seem to have converged in consensus, assigning an editor to propose a pull request to codify that consensus

Beyond recognizing consensus in issue discussions, the editors meeting is not expected to make progress on issue resolution.

The weekly WebRTC Chairs meeting is used to ensure the coordination of efforts around Working Group meetings, coordination with other groups and organizations, to enable Chairs to formulate Working Group decisions (emerging e.g. from calls for consensus) and to lift any obstacle that may be blocking progress on the development of the group's specifications.
